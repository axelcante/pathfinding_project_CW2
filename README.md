Pathfinding Algorithms: Dijkstra and A*

In this 3-person university project we explore different implementations of pathfinding algorithms in a tile-based game using Unity and C#.

You can find the playable version on itch.io (https://ikonico.itch.io/pathfinding) or download the Unity project here and run it on your own machine.

Algorithms implemented:
- Dijkstra
- A* Manhattan Distance
- A* Euclidean Distance
- A* Diagonal Distance
- A* Chebyshev Distance
- A* Octile Distance
